# simple_weather

A Flutter weather app that provides weather information based on the user's location using the Geolocator package. The app uses the BLoC pattern for state management and fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- Get real-time weather information based on the user's location.
- View current weather details including temperature, feels like and summary.
- 5-day weather forecast for a user entered city (Enter a city name in the text field to get that city's forecast).

- Re-launch or Hot Restart the app incase of any Location permission related issue.
- I dont have any way to test this app for iOS. (I don't have any mac device or XCode)
